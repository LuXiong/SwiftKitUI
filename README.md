# SwiftKitUI
用于支持 SwiftUI 不支持的低版本，目前先从 iOS开始做实验开发。最新代码在 developer 分支上面。

To support the low version that SwiftUI does not support, we will start experiment development from iOS. The latest code is on the developer branch.

> 基于苹果除了`SwiftUI`依赖，代码的简洁十分的强大。但是都是必须基于最新版本的支持。最近社区出现`SwiftWebUI`让人十分的震惊，竟然可以这么玩。正好自己需要学习`SwiftUI`，趁此这个机会做一下低版本支持的库。
这个库靠我自己力量估计无法完成，因为我只是 iOS 的新人。对于每个平台的认知，甚至是`Swift5.1`语法都认知有限。可能这个项目会中道崩殂。我希望开发高手接管这个项目之后可以完善的完成，给广大的开发者造福。

> Based on Apple's addition to the `SwiftUI` dependency, the simplicity of the code is very powerful. But all must be based on the latest version of support. The recent emergence of `SwiftWebUI` in the community is very shocking and can be played like this. Just need to learn `SwiftUI`, let me take this opportunity to do a library supported by the lower version.
This library cannot be completed by my own strength, because I am just a newcomer to iOS. For each platform's cognition, even the `Swift5.1` grammar has limited knowledge. Maybe this project will collapse. I hope that the development master can take over the project and complete it, which will benefit the vast number of developers.
